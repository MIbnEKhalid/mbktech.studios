#### Example:

Instead of using `UserAgreement.html`:
- Bad URL: [https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement.html](https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement.html)

Use `UserAgreement/index.html`:
  - Good URL: [https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement/](https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement/)

## Functionality of Our Website:

- **On First Load, Agreement Prompt:**
  - Upon the initial loading of the website, users are prompted to agree with the terms of use.
  - Users cannot proceed to use the website until they accept the terms of use.

- **Accepting Terms of Use:**
  - When a user agrees to the terms of use, the website saves a cookie with an expiry of 1 year.
  - This cookie likely serves as a marker that the user has agreed to the terms and can continue to access the website without being prompted again during this period.

- **Rejecting Terms of Use:**
  - If a user rejects the terms of use, the website loads a disagreement page.
  - After a few seconds, the website redirects the user to google.com.
  - This behavior implies that users who do not agree to the terms are redirected away from the website.
